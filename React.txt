under standing folder structure ----------->
1. node modules --> it is our all node dependenciees
2. public --> public folder doesn't conatain anything as such it only contain inly img file right now so take it as img folder
3. src --> source folder contain our major logic where w ewriite it. (in source folder we have one more folder)
3.1 assests --> it just contain only image of react

genrally when we have to write a code of react wee don not write in index.html nor main.jsx we write it on app.jsx
---- work of index.html is to create root and render it to main.jsx

--->  in app.jsx function is our app compone and what will be this  component return it will become the UI

-----2nd modules
---> 1. when we want to pass no. in props we can't pass them directly we have to pass them in {} curly braces

--->4. conditionals
